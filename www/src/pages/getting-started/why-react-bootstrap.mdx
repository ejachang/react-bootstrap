# Why React-bootstrap?

## A Simple React Component
The CSS and details of Bootstrap components are rather
opinionated and lengthy. React-bootstrap simplifies
this by condensing the original Bootstrap into React-styled
components.

### Vanilla Bootstrap
```
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  A simple primary alert—check it out!
</div>
```

### React Bootstrap
```
<Alert key=0 variant=“primary">
    This is a primary alert—check it out!
</Alert>
 ```
### Reliability with React’s Virtual DOM
React-Bootstrap is a complete re-implementation of the
Bootstrap components using React. It has no dependency
on either bootstrap.js or jQuery. 

Methods and events using jQuery is done imperatively
by directly manipulating the DOM. In contrast, React
uses updates to the state to update the virtual DOM.
In this way, React-bootstrap provides a more reliable
solution by incorporating Bootstrap functionality into 
React's virtual DOM. 

### Bootstrap with state
Since React bootstrap is built with React Javascript, state
can be passed within React-bootstrap components as a prop.
It also makes it easier to manage the state as updates are
made using React’s state instead of directly manipulating
the state of the DOM. 

### A Simpler Set up
React-bootstrap is less verbose than Bootstrap since jQuery
and Popper are not required for its javascript. If you have
React setup and React-Bootstrap installed you have everything
you need.
